1.Test Project
This project is running on Angular 10.
This is Basic crud operation. Althogh Edit is not functional but we can follow the same process which we used for Add. We will need to just pass value in form like mentioned Below.

   this.TaskForm = this.formBuilder.group({
            title: ['Abhi', Validators.required],
            author: ['Abhi', Validators.required]
        }); 


2.Setting Up Project
This project already has node modules in it so we don't need to run npm i.

3.For Db 
Please use the command below to install json server
npm i json-server

npm install -g json-server

4. run this project 
 
 
 First we will need to run db in terminal using the command below
  json-server --watch db.json

Then we need to run angular part via
  
  ng serve --open 
  to open this project in web browser

  or we can use 
  ng serve --aot



5. Generate build

To generate it's Build

please use ng build --prod

This in turn will create a dist folder in MyTest. Just create a zip of that and upload it to server.
